# Heston-Option-Pricing
A Monte Carlo option pricing simulation using the Heston model for stochastic volatility.

## Motivation
This repo was created to support an [OMIS 6000](https://schulich.yorku.ca/courses/omis-6000-3-00/) "Models & 
Applications in Operational Research" group project as part of a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the 
[Schulich School of Business](https://schulich.yorku.ca/).

This goal of the project was to conduct a Monte Carlo analysis using Excel and the [FrontlineSolvers](https://www.solver.com/) 
add-in.  We extended this in Python to make a more robust simulation that can reduce the simulation error by increasing
both the number of time steps and the number of simulations.

## Theory
This code estimates the present value of, and hence price, an European call option on a given stock.  The payout of the 
option at maturity (time = _T_) is given by the equation below. 

![Pt](docs/Pt.png)

The present expected value of the option, which is the price _c_, is given by the equation below.  

![c](docs/c.png)

So the problem becomes making many stochastic projections of the possible evolutions of the stock price _S<sub>t</sub>_ 
from _S<sub>0</sub>_ to _S<sub>T</sub>_ and then taking the average values of _P<sub>T</sub>_ to estimate 
_E[P<sub>T</sub>]_ in the above equation.  To do this we used the Heston Model, which includes a stochastic term for 
both the price movement and its volatility as shown in the equation below.

The correlation of the two Brownian motions _dW<sub>S</sub>_ and _dW<sub>V</sub>_ is represented by the coefficient ùúå.
Therefore we determined _dW<sub>S</sub>_ from the following equation.

![dws](docs/dws.png)

To perform the simulation, we generated _n_ independent random values of _dW<sub>i</sub>_ and _dW<sub>V</sub>_ from a 
normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of sqrt(_dt_).  Starting with initial values of 
_S<sub>0</sub>_ and _V<sub>0</sub>_, the constants ùúé, ùúÉ, ùúÖ, _dt_, ùúå and the random variables _dW<sub>i</sub>_ and 
_dW<sub>V</sub>_, we then calculate the time evolution of both _S<sub>t</sub>_ and _V<sub>t</sub>_.  We repeated this 
_m_ times to estimate the mean expected value.  Following the paper by Broadie, we will set the following constants.

![constants](docs/constants.png)

To add a third random term, we repeated this process another _p_ times with discrete random values for ùúå as shown above.
The mean of these _m*p_ values of _P<sub>T</sub>_ allows us to estimate _E[P<sub>T</sub>]_ and hence the option price 
_c_.
