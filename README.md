# Heston-Option-Pricing
A Monte Carlo option pricing simulation using the Heston model for stochastic volatility.

## Motivation
This repo was created to support an [OMIS 6000](https://schulich.yorku.ca/courses/omis-6000-3-00/) "Models & 
Applications in Operational Research" group project as part of a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the 
[Schulich School of Business](https://schulich.yorku.ca/).

This goal of the project was to conduct a Monte Carlo analysis using Excel and the [FrontlineSolvers](https://www.solver.com/) 
add-in.  We extended this in Python to make a more robust simulation that can reduce the simulation error by increasing
both the number of time steps and the number of simulations.
